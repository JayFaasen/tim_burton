        <p>Visitors will chart their own course through the mind of the genius to explore his favorite characters and environments from his wide and celebrated filmography. In this way, the exhibition provides a unique experience; an exciting journey through the creative universe of the director, producer, writer, and artist that has amazed both children and adults with such films as Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The journey will take approximately 1 hour, depending on the path chosen.</p>

        <h3>The world of Tim Burton</h3>
        <p>Drawn from Tim Burton’s personal archive and representing the artist’s creative output from childhood to the present day, this exhibition of 500 drawings, paintings, photographs, sketchbooks, moving-image works, and sculptural installations focuses on the recurrent visual themes and motifs that resonate in the distinctive characters and worlds found in Burton’s art and films.</p>

        <p>The exhibition reveals an inimitable style that is informed by Burton’s <strong>specific perspectives</strong>. His amalgamations of man, animal, and machine are evocative of an artistically-inclined Dr. Frankenstein with an unfettered imagination. The interplay between horror and humor figures prominently in Burton’s art and films and this theme of the “carnivalesque”—the mixture between comedy and the grotesque—is seen in projects from Batman to Alice in Wonderland.</p>
